  "description": "This is a simple web app that works like a To-do list. The user can type an item to add to their list and then check it off when they completed the task. I used a Javascript library called React to build this web application because To-do lists are always super helpful to me and I am always using them. I know how helpful a To-do list can be for me so I wanted to see if I can teach myself useful skills while making a product that I would use.",
