# Overview

This is a simple web app that works like a To-do list. The user can type an item to add to their list and then check it off when they completed the task. I used a Javascript library called React to build this web application because To-do lists are always super helpful to me and I am always using them. I know how helpful a To-do list can be for me so I wanted to see if I can teach myself useful skills while making a product that I would use.

I was able to teach myself and learn about Javascript and React as I was building this app. I learned about functional and class components as I was writing the code to add a users inputs into a list. I plan to add a nonrelational database to store the users data and make the web application save a users progress / list.

# Development Environment

I used a Javascript library called React. React is used to build single page applications and is super useful when building good user interfaces. I used some Youtube tutorials to set up my React environment and learn some basic things about React. I would also use w3schools when I ran into some troubles or had any specific questions about React's syntax.
